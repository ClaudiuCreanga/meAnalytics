## Description

App (currently as a chrome extension) that helps you gather data about yourself. It generates useful reports so that you can find meaningful patterns about yourself.

For now, the browser extension tracks the websites you're active on and lets you determine which are good or bad for your productivity. For example, as a programmer, potentially bad websites are email, ticketing systems etc. and good websites are stackoverflow and any websites you are currently working on.

It also has a notification feature that will allow you to create custom alerts.

## Usage
```
npm install
grunt
grunt watch
```
